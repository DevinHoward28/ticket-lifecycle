This is the first stage of the ticket lifecycle, which is when the end user creates a help desk ticket. When an end user creates a ticket, they must include their email, full name, phone number, help topic, and a summary of the issue. This information allows the help desk employees to keep an open line of communication with the customer and determine the business impact.

In the assignment and communication stage, the help desk employees discuss and assign the ticket to the department that correlates to the issue. This is also the stage where the SLA plan and the due date are determined.

The last and final stage of the ticket lifecycle is working on the ticket and resolution. This consists of troubleshooting and fixing the issue. For example in this ticket, Jane was the agent that worked the ticket and found out that the outage was caused by a recent update.
